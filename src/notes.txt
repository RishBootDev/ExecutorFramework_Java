java provides its own multithreading framework called the Java Executor Framework
which is introduced in Jdk 5 in java.util.concurrent package.

The Executor framework in Java provides a high level abstraction for managing
concurrent tasks in Java application. It simplifies multi threading by
handling tasks such as thread creation, management and scheduling. One of its key
features is the thread pool, which reuses existing threads instead of creating new
ones, improving efficiency and resource management

Executor
=========
This interface is the core of the framework and it provides the execute method
(Runnable) which takes the tasks and then submits them to the thread pool for
execution

execute(Runnable object) -> this function scedules the execution of a given command\
to occur sometime in the future. The command might run in a new thread , a pooled thread
or the calling thread depending on how the executor is implemented.

executor.execute(threadObject)

ThreadPoolExecutor:- This is one of the most
commonly used implementations of the
ExecutorService interface. It manages a pool of
worker threads and provides fine-grained control
over thread management, allowing you to specify
parameters like the core pool size, maximum pool
size, and various queueing strategies.
Java thread pool manages the pool of worker
threads. It contains a queue that keeps tasks
waiting to get executed.

ScheduledExecutorService:
=========================
This extends the
Executor framework to support scheduling tasks to
run at specific times or with fixed time
intervals. It's particularly useful for
implementing tasks that need to be executed
periodically, such as cleanup tasks or periodic
data updates.

majorly all the multithreading related work is done using this
Class while using frameworks like SpringBoot, Hibernate, etc
